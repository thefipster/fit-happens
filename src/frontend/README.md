# fit-happens

*A barely serious fitness tracker for barely fit developers.*

## Overview

**Project fit-happens** is a personal project to track calisthenics progress using a custom-built stack:

- 💾 **Web API** – Handles data storage and synchronization
- 📱 **React Native Frontend** – Mobile app for logging workouts and tracking progress

We're not athletes. We're just two devs trying to do a muscle-up.

## Disclaimer

This app is not production-ready. It’s barely gym-ready.
