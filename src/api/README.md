# Fit Happens API

This is the backend API for the **fit-happens** ecosystem â€“ a fitness journaling platform focused on flexibility, local-first data handling, and sync-friendly architecture.

The API manages user journal data, including workouts, exercises, tags, and bodyweight entries. Clients (e.g. mobile or web apps) can read, write, and synchronize structured fitness events using a unified message format.

Authentication is handled via an API key (`x-api-key` header).

## Integration

This API is designed to be used by the **fit-happens** client libraries and apps. It acts as a central sync hub for journals, enabling local storage and offline-first usage patterns, while still supporting cloud sync and multi-device access.

## Authentication

All endpoints require a valid API key passed in the `x-api-key` header.
