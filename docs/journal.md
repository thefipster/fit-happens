## 💪 Fit Happens – Pumping State with Journaling Gains

Welcome to the iron-core of *Fit Happens*: a **journal-based architecture** that keeps your app reps clean and your state pumped.

### 🧠 The Concept (No Pain, No State)

Every time a user does something in the app — adds a set, logs a workout, edits a lift — we **don’t just store the result**, we **log the action**. These logs go into our **training journal**: an append-only stream of truthy fitness history.

Think of it like a workout diary, but for your app state.

### 🔁 Replay for Gains

The journal isn’t just for show — it’s how we **build muscle memory** for the app. Replaying the journal:

* Reconstructs the app’s state from scratch
* Applies or undoes actions like a spotter with time travel powers

### 🏋️ Example Rep

**User logs a new set:**

1. A journal message is created: reps, timestamp, exercise, tags
2. Our `StateReplayer` flexes its logic:

   * Updates the current app view model
   * Updates historical stats (PRs, trends, bragging rights)

### ✅ Why This Approach Gets You Ripped

* **Deterministic State:** No flab, just pure function.
* **Auditability:** Every rep logged, every stat explained.
* **Debug-friendly:** Want to see what went wrong? Just hit replay.
* **Undo?** No sweat. Just roll it back.

### 📝 TL;DR

Our journal is the single source of **fitness truth**. It tracks every move, powers the app’s state, and lets us replay or rewind like a workout montage in a cheesy '80s movie.
